# OSCE Hub

Open Source Community Evaluation  Hub is an organization that promotes community involvement and excellence within the open-source landscape. 
Our mission is to establish an impactful community-centric rating metric - OSCE_Rating, which assesses open-source projects primarily on community-related factors like engagement, growth potential, inclusivity, sustainability, and traditional factors like code quality. 
At OSCEHub, we are dedicated to providing a well-rounded, reliable standard that assists developers, contributors, and users in discerning open-source projects that excel not just in code but also in community strength and dynamism. We firmly believe in the transformative power of open source and are committed to nurturing a vibrant, inclusive, and productive open-source ecosystem.
